      <h2>Software Engineer</h2>

      <p>
        I'm a software engineer with <span id="experience">13</span>+ years of
        experience creating new products and leading growing teams across many
        industries. I love solving people's problems with beautiful UI and
        high-performance code that scales.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I'm leading frontend development at
        <a href="https://teamworks.com">Teamworks</a> and building
        <a href="https://github.com/barbinbrad/carbon">Carbon ERP</a> in my
        spare time. Outside of
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web APIs</a>,
        my favorite tools are <a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a>,
        <a href="https://supabase.com/">Supabase</a>,
        <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> and
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/">CDK</a>.

      <h1 data-page-break-before>Background</h1>
      <p>
        I started doing web development for other people in 2006. I was in high
        school, and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery">jQuery</a> wasn't a thing
        yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduating from
        <a href="https://cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon</a> in 2011, I started a
        <a href="https://youtu.be/9edWuCs9nl0?t=142">software company</a> that
        used
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing"
          >NLP</a
        >
        to make public information more accessible online. The startup was
        unable to find product-market fit, but it left me with a strong sense
        that building software was something I was good at and something I
        really enjoyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        To really learn the craft, I spent time working in digital agencies like
        <a href="https://rga.com">R/GA</a> and
        <a href="https://smashingboxes.com">Smashing Boxes</a>. There I gained
        experience as both a project manager and as an engineer while working
        for big clients like Quintiles, Walmart, and Nike.
      </p>
      <p>
        After improving my skills, I was ready for another challenge. I moved to
        California to work on a few startups, as both a co-founder and an early
        employee.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2015 I decided to move back to Pennsylvania to be closer to family.
        Since there were no software companies in my town, I joined a
        manufacturing company. I was delighted to find many complex problems
        that could be solved with software. I was also humbled by the domain
        knowledge of the people I worked with.
      </p>
      <p>
        At <a href="https://gapvax.com">GapVax</a>, I began to practice a
        bottom-up approach for collaborating across departments to build systems
        that benefit the entire company. This is a skill that I have continued
        to improve throughout my career, and is something that I view as a key
        part of my role as a software engineering leader.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last decade, I have gained an incredible breadth of experience
        in both software and business. I excel at rapid prototyping, listening
        to people, and designing complex systems that meet the needs of everyone
        involved. I feel that my passion for the work, my willingness to go the
        extra mile, and my faith make me a valuable addition to any team.

      <h1 data-page-break-before>Skills</h1>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>

      <p>
        <a href="">TypeScript</a> is my primary language for doing anything web
        or mobile-related. I know a few good ways to (not) manage global state
        and get full type safety from the database to the UI.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been doing JavaScript for long time, but my grasp on the language
        was greatly improved by my time writing C# and Elixir. C# gave me a
        strong foundation in types, and Elixir gave me a strong foundation in
        functional programming.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">web</a>
        continues to improve, I try to do the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        My <a href="https://github.com/barbinbrad/carbon">current stack</a> is:
      </p>

      <ul class="inline-list">

        <li><a href="https://turbo.build/">Turborepo</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>HTML/CSS</h2>

      <p>
        HTML and CSS is where I started, so I have a strong understanding of the
        fundamentals. Recently I've made an effort to understand the WAI-ARIA
        spec and I know how difficult it is to make a site
        <em>truly</em> accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've built a few component libraries. For a while, I was using Chakra
        for this. But currently, I'm using Radix with Tailwind to avoid the
        runtime cost of styled-components.
      </p>

      <h2>Frontend</h2>

      <p>
        I have professional experience with many frontend frameworks. Most
        recently I've been using <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a> and
        <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue</a>. I'm not particularly keen on any
        one framework. They all use a declarative model. But I think that React
        currently has the best ecosystem, so it remains my framework of choice.
      </p>

      <p>
        I try to avoid dependencies like the plague, but some of my favorite
        packages are:
      </p>

      <ul class="inline-list">
        <li><a href="https://airbnb.io/visx/">Visx</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://cmdk.paco.me/">⌘K</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://tiptap.dev/">Tiptap</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://cva.style/docs/">CVA</a></li>
        <a href="https://radix-ui.com/">Radix UI</a>
        <li><a href="https://www.framer.com/motion/">Framer Motion</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://react-select.com/home">React Select</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://tanstack.com/table/v8">Tanstack Table</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/colinhacks/zod">Zod</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Backend</h2>
      <p>
        I've got production experience with a handful of backend frameworks,
        like
        <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/introduction"
          >.NET</a
        >, <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a>,
        <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/">Flask</a>, and
        <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. If I had to pick one, I'd
        choose Phoenix because of its
        <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/processes.html"
          >processes</a
        >
        and built-in distributed pubsub.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have strong opinions on REST vs. GraphQL vs RPC, but I do prefer
        SQL over NoSQL for persistence in most cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've got a ton of experience writing SQL, and I prefer
        <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a>. When possible, I
        like to move business logic into the database through triggers, views,
        and functions. I'm also a big advocate for row-level-security.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of improving performance, I try to make the solution match the
        problem. Lately I've been using
        <a href="redis.io">Redis</a> and
        <a href="https://docs.bullmq.io/">BullMQ</a> for caching and message
        queues.
      </p>

      <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>
        I've got enough working knowledge of the principles to be a solid
        contributor to infrastructure, particularly in terms of automating
        pipelines to stand up environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        My personal preference is to use serverless tools like
        <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>,
        <a href="https://supabase.com">Supabase</a>, and
        <a href="https://upstash.com">Upstash</a> in the early stages, and then
        move to AWS via the CDK when either the cost or performance advantages
        tip the scales.
      </p>

      <ul class="inline-list">
        <li></li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/">Gitlab Pipelines</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/">AWS CDK</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a></li>
        <li>Git</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Automation</h2>

      <p>
        I've spent a lot of time automating tasks, paperwork, and machines. For
        me the secret to good automation is figuring out how to get things that
        don't naturally talk together to get on the same page. I'm a big fan of
        protocols for this reason, and if there is no protocol, I'm happy to
        invent one.
      </p>

      <p>These are some protocols that I like:</p>

      <ul class="inline-list">
        <li>HTTP</li>
        <li>Web Sockets</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/barbinbrad/dispatch">JSON RPC</a></li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/barbinbrad/openpilot-101">CAN Bus</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="http://zeromq">0MQ</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://capnproto.org/">Cap'n Proto</a></li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT">MQTT</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://webrtc.org/">Web RTC</a></li>
        <li>Excel</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Leadership</h2>

      <p>
        I am experienced in leading small to medium development teams (3–6), and
        I'm currently leading FE development across many small teams. I often
        take the role of thought leader on code quality as well as performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have no goal to transition into a management role, but I love helping
        people develop in their careers. I try to lead from below, without any
        formal authority. For me, that means continually learning, teaching,
        joking and listening.

      <h2>Carnegie Mellon University</h2>
      <p>
        I graduated with a B.S. in Business Administration in 2011. During my
        time there, I took the hardest math classes I could find and finished
        one project short of a double-major in Human-Computer Interaction. At
        the time, I was very focused on my startup.
